  <h2> About </h2>
  <p>
  Newsify gets all the latest headlines from different news sources such as NDTV and The Times of India and then answers questions for you.

Newsify uses a question-answering model that has been deployed to the cloud to answer your questions regarding the headline. The question-answer model will try to guess the answer from the article content of the headline. But this also brings in some limitations such as its inability to answer questions that may be related to the headline but are not answered in the actual article content.

The headlines are scraped from the Google's news section, so even though we are limited to three news channels currently we can expand this to any kind of news channel whose headlines can be scraped from Google's news section.
